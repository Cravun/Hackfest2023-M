# Sagip 
SAGIP, a digital platform to address the insufficiency and inaccessibility of the donated blood supply through digitalization of both blood donor and request application, as well as creating an educational space comprising everything a donor may need to know.

Accessibility: Easy access to blood donation centers is essential for encouraging people to donate blood. By providing comprehensive educational resources, potential donors can understand the benefits of their contribution to society. Accessible online maps or mobile applications can help donors quickly locate the nearest center, making the process more convenient.

Convenience: Convenience is key when it comes to blood donation. By streamlining the process of recording personal and health information, donors can submit a blood donation or request form in a matter of seconds. This not only saves time but also ensures accuracy in the information collected, making the donation process more efficient and effective.

Gamification and reward system: Donors can earn badges by learning and donating, which can encourage them to continue donating and spread awareness about the importance of blood donation. In addition, offering a SaGIFT package for every blood donor can further incentivize the act of donating blood and show appreciation for their contribution to society. These types of initiatives can help increase the number of blood donations and ultimately save lives.

SAGIP empowers individuals to save lives by leveraging modern technologies in aiding the blood donor application and request process while providing comprehensive education, all in one convenient digital platform.
