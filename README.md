# Sagip 

SAGIP is an adaptive solution to the insufficiency and inaccessibility of blood supply through digitalization of both blood donor and request application. Sagip also provides comprehensive educational resources, potential donors can understand the benefits of their contribution to society and themselves. 

**Accessibility:** Easy access to blood donation centers through mobile application puts donors and recipients first on the line. This feature will encourage people to donate blood, and help finding and requesting directly to facilities for those in need of one. SAGIP implements a function which shows the nearest blood facility, and aids in sending blood donor/request application directly to the chosen facility. 

**Convenience:** Long queues and processing is a huge hindrance in donors. By streamlining the process of recording personal and health information, donors can submit a blood donation or request form in a matter of seconds. This not only saves time but also ensures accuracy in the information collected, making the donation process more efficient and effective.

**Gamification and Reward System:** Donors can earn rewards by donating and learning. Incentives can encourage donors to continue donating and spread news about SAGIP, which would result into more donors through the app. In addition, offering a SaGIFT package for every blood donor can further incentivize the act of donating blood and show appreciation for their contribution to society. These types of initiatives can help increase the number of blood donations and ultimately save lives.

SAGIP empowers individuals to save lives by leveraging modern technologies in aiding the blood donor application and request process while providing comprehensive education, all in one convenient digital platform.
